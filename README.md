**`TimecodeReader`** can read an audio input signal using either a microphone, or line-level input and decode [SMPTE/EBU Timecode](http://www.philrees.co.uk/articles/timecode.htm) in real time.  Use the "**Input**" menu to select the source of the signal and then press "**Start**" to begin realtime timecode decoding and display.  Then, adjust the "**Input Level**" slider to keep the bar graph within a reasonable range. If you're using a microphone input, you may also need to use an audio attenuator cable to reduce the signal level and avoid overdriving the input.

The checkboxes in the "**Information Bits**" section display the settings of some special "**Flag**" bits included in each frame of the timecode stream.  These are used to provide additional information for advanced users, but the meaing of these bits has evolved over time and also depends on the timecode frame rate, so [check this reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_timecode) for more info on what these bits mean, or hover or each checkbox to display some brief tooltip text.  The line of 8 digits above the checkboxes display the value of some additional special bits called "**User**" bits which are normally used to record an 8 digit BCD number for purposes such as recording date, scene, or take information.  The "**Estimated Frame Rate**" field tries to estimate the frame rate by watching for the maximum frame number between sucessive seconds and displaying the value + 1.

Using the "**Record**" menu you can configure **`TimecodeReader`** to capture and record decoded timecode, raw timecode frames, or both to the "Record" tab and then save this text to a file.  Thsi feature was added to aid evaluation and comparison of various timecode generators and enable analysis of their outputs.

For your convenience, an executable .jar file for **`TimecodeReader`** can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/wholder/TimecodeReader/tree/master/out/artifacts/TimecodeReader_jar).  On most systems you can run the .jar file by double clicking it to launch.  Note: on OSX, you may need to [right click and select "Open"](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25088?locale=en_US) the first time you run the program.
